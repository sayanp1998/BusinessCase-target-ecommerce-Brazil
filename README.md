# BusinessCase-target-ecommerce-Brazil

Business Problem:
Target is one of the world’s most recognized brands and one of America’s leading retailers. This business case has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at Target in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, delivery time, order price, payment details, freight performance and customer location. We have to generate business insights and provide recommendations (backed by data) using this dataset.

## Business Case study Highlight
1. We have used BigQuery(SQL) to study the data stored across multiple tables.
2. We have used Tableau for creating plots to communicate the business insights and recommendations.
3. We have uploaded 2 pdf files:
    - targetSQL_bizCase_complete.pdf: Contains the entire business case with plots, figures and reasoning behind our conclusions.
    - targetSQL_queries.pdf: Contains just the SQL queries.
